# Valkyrie Archives - Military Archival Database

## Project Description

The **Valkyrie Archives** is a fictional military archival database designed to manage and analyze data related to military missions, resources, and personnel. The system is structured to capture the intricate workings of a military organization by managing five key tables:

- **Equipment**: Tracks equipment inventory and issuance.
- **Personnel**: Manages details about military personnel, including rank and roles.
- **Operations**: Logs details of missions and their execution.
- **Incidents**: Records incidents occurring during missions.
- **Outcomes**: Tracks the results of missions and their impact.

The database incorporates **triggers**, **stored procedures**, and **business rules** to simulate real-world military processes, such as automating mission assignments and resource tracking.

## Business Case

This database project simulates how military operations might be tracked and managed behind the scenes in governmental or confidential organizations. Inspired by a fascination with military systems and books like Tom Clancyâ€™s *The Hunt for Red October*, this project showcases the importance of data management in ensuring accountability and operational success.

The database offers a conceptual model of how military organizations could handle logistical challenges, such as:

- Tracking personnel based on rank and mission history.
- Monitoring resource allocation to ensure proper accountability.
- Recording mission outcomes for performance analysis.

### Target Audience

The target audience includes governments, military organizations, and agencies tasked with managing operations and resources efficiently.
